*Figure 1: Output from the linear regression on MechaCar data*<br />

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  * The variables that provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values are vehicle_length and ground_clearance 
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  * The p-value of the linear regression is less than 0.05, therefore the slope is not zero 
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  * The R-squared value is roughly 71%, which tells us that for about ~71% of the time, the model will predict mpg values correctly.
